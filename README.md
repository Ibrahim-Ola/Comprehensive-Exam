## Machine Learning in Python Tutorial 

This tutorial was developed for the [SnowEx Hackweek](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/intro.html) that held between July 12 - 16.

The goal of this tutorial is to;

1. Understand the goals and main concepts of a Machine Learning Algorithm
2. Prepare a SnowEx dataset for Machine Learning
3. Understand the fundamental types of and techniques in Machine Learning
4. Implement Machine Learning with a SnowEx dataset 

### How to Use this Tutorial

#### 1. Download Anaconda

Download Anaconda installer for your operating system (OS) using this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Afterwards, intall the Anaconda setup follwing the instructions for your OS found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

#### 2. Clone this Repository ####

    git clone https://github.com/Ibrahim-Ola/Comprehensive-Exam.git

#### 3. Launch Anaconda and Open Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

* Windows: Open the Anaconda Navigator. The window that pops up when it opens should have `Jupyter Notebook` and `Jupyter Lab`. Select anyone you want and launch it. When it opens, navigate to the directory housing the cloned repository.
* Linux/Mac: Open your terminal and type `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`.  When it opens, navigate to the directory housing the cloned repository.

Note: the cloned repo will be zipped, so unzip it to access the files in there.

#### 4. Install Additional Libraries ####

All packages needed come pre-installed in Anaconda except for TensorFlow. Install TensorFlow using:

    conda install tensorflow

Note: the `tensorflow` installation command above assumes that you are installing using a command line interface such as Anconda promt for Windows or Terminal for Linux/Mac. To install directly from Jupyter, use: `!conda install tensorflow`.
